>>> AGI(Aritificial General Intelligence) and AI vs AGI:
Current AI models are specific /narrow AI and need to be well-trained for a specific purpose/task. For example, Computer Vision or Convolutional neural network models can only recognize and detect object and pattern images. But the same CNN Models can not even create a single website. So, there are no such models that would perform general tasks and have abilities like we humans do.

AGI is the theoretical concept and research study that attempts to create an AI model that does not need to be explicitly trained and developed for specific tasks like RNN models. 

AGI is considered to be self-learning, self-teaching, solving problems, and showing cognitive abilities.

AGI is believed to be true AI and LLMs(Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Bard, Claude AI, and LLAMs) are the most promising path to the AGI.

So AGI is a strong AI that is yet to be realized and practically implemented in the real world. 

AGI models are expected to perform tasks like that can cook your food, helping to complete assignments, diagnosing medical reports, playing games, driving, and so on...

Challenges of AGI are:
>> The connection between the different domain-specific models is unknown, due to unfamiliar training datasets and algorithms
>> Sensory Perception requires further enhancement as we humans do embed with emotional intelligence, does the computer feel emotion ever? Because they are the binary bits 0 and 1 and the >> LLM response is straightforward with the linguistic style and syntactic parse tree grammar.

Relevant Terminologies:
>> Data Mining is the process of extracting features, patterns, and knowledge from a relatively large dataset(big data) that relates to human behavior and interactions like recommendation systems, and sentiment analysis.

>> Overfitting: The model memorizes the training data as well, including noise and outliers which does not give new patterns or expected output
>> Underfitting: Cannot perform and capture the underlying pattern in both training and new data resulting in poor performance.

>> Hyperparameters are those classes of parameters that are set before the model learning process begins, including epoch, number of batch sizes, and learning rate.

Types of AI 
1. Narrow or Weak AI

4. Reinforcement Learning

Types of Deep Learning:
1. Neural Networks (Artificial Neural Networks)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

>>>> AI Models are hungry for data and more QUALITY/STRUCTURED Data, better the AI Model performance and output. 

Narrow or Weak AI:
    - Designed and trained for specific tasks like spam filter, fraud detection, facial recognition, and recommendation system
    - mostly used AI models at the current time 

ML Categories:

1. Supervised Learning
    - provided both correct input(labelled data) and output data, models learns to map input --> output
    - Correct Answer is known and output - prediction is mostly correct
    - Supervised Algorithms are mostly used in business-level application 
    
    Mapping from x to y 
    input 'x'             output 'y'                        Application
    email   --->          spam?                             spam filter
    audio ----->          text transcripts                  speech recognition
    English ---->         Spanish/Nepali                    machine translation
    ad, user info ->      click                             online ads
    image, radar info --> position of the cars              self-driving cars
    image defect--->      defect?                           computer vision
